Tests of Machine Intelligence,"Although the definition and measurement of intelligence is clearly of
fundamental importance to the field of artificial intelligence, no general
survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence exists. Indeed few
researchers are even aware of alternatives to the Turing test and its many
derivatives. In this paper we fill this gap by providing a short survey of the
many tests of machine intelligence that have been proposed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3825v1,"Shane Legg, Marcus Hutter",2007,cs,arxiv,,0.7028402,The case for psychometric artificial general intelligence,0.5282888,0.7170227,0.6533817052841187,0.5039939880371094,0.4537563920021057,0.4537563920021057,0.44378888607025146,"Does an artificial intelligence perform market manipulation with its own

"Does an artificial intelligence perform market manipulation with its own
  discretion? -- A genetic algorithm learns in an artificial market simulation","Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence
performing market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I
constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in
an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial
intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial
market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention
of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered
market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests
necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence
to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10488v1,Takanobu Mizuta,2020,q-fin,arxiv,,0.5657947,,0.5657947,0.897583,0.921705961227417,0.8872004747390747,0.4697742462158203,0.42291224002838135,0.350675106048584,"Proceedings of the Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial

How to Design AI for Social Good: Seven Essential Factors.,"The idea of artificial intelligence for social good (henceforth AI4SG) is gaining traction within information societies in general and the AI community in particular. It has the potential to tackle social problems through the development of AI-based solutions. Yet, to date, there is only limited understanding of what makes AI socially good in theory, what counts as AI4SG in practice, and how to reproduce its initial successes in terms of policies. This article addresses this gap by identifying seven ethical factors that are essential for future AI4SG initiatives. The analysis is supported by 27 case examples of AI4SG projects. Some of these factors are almost entirely novel to AI, while the significance of other factors is heightened by the use of AI. From each of these factors, corresponding best practices are formulated which, subject to context and balance, may serve as preliminary guidelines to ensure that well-designed AI is more likely to serve the social good.",,Floridi Luciano; Cowls Josh; King Thomas C; Taddeo Mariarosaria,2020,Biosciences,pubmed,32246245,0.71425116,AI for social good and the corporate capture of global development.,0.39594376,0.07989005,0.7142512202262878,0.3913246989250183,0.3831588625907898,0.350675106048584,0.34843188524246216,AI for social good and the corporate capture of global development.,Tests of Machine Intelligence,The case for psychometric artificial general intelligence,"Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial

"Putting AI Ethics into Practice: The Hourglass Model of Organizational
  AI Governance","The organizational use of artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly spread
across various sectors. Alongside the awareness of the benefits brought by AI,
there is a growing consensus on the necessity of tackling the risks and
potential harms, such as bias and discrimination, brought about by advanced AI
technologies. A multitude of AI ethics principles have been proposed to tackle
these risks, but the outlines of organizational processes and practices for
ensuring socially responsible AI development are in a nascent state. To address
the paucity of comprehensive governance models, we present an AI governance
framework, the hourglass model of organizational AI governance, which targets
organizations that develop and use AI systems. The framework is designed to
help organizations deploying AI systems translate ethical AI principles into
practice and align their AI systems and processes with the forthcoming European
AI Act. The hourglass framework includes governance requirements at the
environmental, organizational, and AI system levels. At the AI system level, we
connect governance requirements to AI system life cycles to ensure governance
throughout the system's life span. The governance model highlights the systemic
nature of AI governance and opens new research avenues into its practical
implementation, the mechanisms that connect different AI governance layers, and
the dynamics between the AI governance actors. The model also offers a starting
point for organizational decision-makers to consider the governance components
needed to ensure social acceptability, mitigate risks, and realize the
potential of AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00335v2,"Matti Mäntymäki, Matti Minkkinen, Teemu Birkstedt, Mika Viljanen",2022,cs,arxiv,,0.7366338,How to Design AI for Social Good: Seven Essential Factors.,0.37934902,0.0,0.3342132866382599,0.3000088930130005,,,,Tests of Machine Intelligence,"Proceedings of the Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial

AI for social good and the corporate capture of global development.,"This article focuses on the AI for Social Good (AI4SG) movement, which aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). It argues that, through AI4SG, Big Tech is attempting to advance AI-driven technosolutionism within the development policy and scholarly space creating new opportunities for rent extraction. The article situates AI4SG, within the history of ICT4D. It also highlights the contiguity of AI4SG with the so-called 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR), a framework that places AI and other digital innovations at the center of national and international development and industrial policy agendas. By exploring how Big Tech has attempted to depoliticize datafication, we thus suggest that AI4SG and 4IR are mutually reinforcing discourses that serve the purpose of depoliticizing the development arena by bestowing legitimacy and authority to Big Tech to reshape policy spaces and epistemic infrastructures while inserting themselves, to an unprecedented degree, between the citizen (data) and the state (development and policy).",,Iazzolino Gianluca; Stremlau Nicole,2024,Biosciences,pubmed,39508029,0.3871652,,0.3871652,0.037628423,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
